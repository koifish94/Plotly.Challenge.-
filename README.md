In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
